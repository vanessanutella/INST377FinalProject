        <h2>How to use this webite</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        This website utilizes the Spending Information for FY 2022 API within Prince George’s County Open Data. I would like to work with this API because I am interested in 
        getting a better understanding of what county governments prioritize when it comes to allocating funds. In this project, I am hoping to examine which agencies or sectors 
        received the most funding during the year 2022, and if there are any agencies that were underfunded compared to other agencies. This is important to examine because it 
        could potentially reveal agencies that are getting too much or too little funding, which can impact the ability of those agencies to complete their tasks or function properly. 
        It could also help identify any inequity within county level funding and understand why current situations or circumstances exist within Prince George’s county. This project focuses on the 
        following attributes from the API: name, payment_description, and amount.

        The website is organized with the data visualization at the top and the descriptions of the different agencies at the bottom. Regarding the visualization, users can press the 
        dropdown menu to select the data they would like to look at. They can look at the data for the amount of money allocated to each agency, or the amount of money allocated for different reasons (payment descriptions).

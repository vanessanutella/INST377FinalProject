Project Title: 2022 Prince George's County County Flow of Funding

This project can be accessed on both iOS and Android browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, etc. This project does not require any browser specificatitions and can be accessed using a variety of iOS or Android technology.

This project utilizes the Spending Information for FY 2022 API within Prince George’s County Open Data. Link to API: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Finance-and-Budget/Spending-Information-for-FY-2022/jh2p-ym6a 

In my project, I generated bar charts using the Chart.js library to visualize the amount of funding 5 different agencies received in 2022, and another bar chart to visualize how much funding went towards different payment_descriptions or uses. The project is coded using HTML, JavaScript, and the CSS flexbox CSS framework.

In this project, I am hoping to examine which agencies or sectors received the most funding during the year 2022, and if there are any agencies that were underfunded compared to other agencies. This is important to examine because it could potentially reveal agencies that are getting too much or too little funding, which can impact the ability of those agencies to complete their tasks or function properly. It could also help identify any inequity within county level funding and understand why current situations or circumstances exist within Prince George’s county.
